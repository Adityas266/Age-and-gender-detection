# 🔍 Age and Gender Detection

This project is a Python-based application for detecting and predicting the age and gender of individuals from images using deep learning techniques.

## Overview 🌐

The Age and Gender Detection application utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze facial features and predict the age and gender of individuals in images. It provides an accurate and efficient way to estimate demographic information from images, with applications in various fields such as marketing, security, and demographics research.

## Features 🛠️

- **Facial Detection:** Detects and extracts faces from input images.
- **Age Prediction:** Predicts the age of individuals based on facial features.
- **Gender Prediction:** Predicts the gender of individuals based on facial features.
- **Real-time Processing:** Supports real-time age and gender detection from webcam feeds.
- **Customizable:** Easily customizable model architectures and parameters for improved accuracy.

## Installation 🚀

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Adityas266/Age-and-gender-detection.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the pre-trained model weights (if not included in the repository).
4. Run the application: `python age_gender_detection.py`

## Usage 🔧

1. Prepare input images containing faces for age and gender detection.
2. Run the `age_gender_detection.py` script to process the images and display the predicted age and gender.
3. Optionally, use the real-time processing mode to detect age and gender from webcam feeds.
4. Analyze the results and use the predicted demographic information as needed.
